# SCHOOL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## 🎯 Introduction 
This project outlines the development of a Java-based application for managing a school system. The system allows users to manage students and teachers, track payments, and provide a summary of the school's financials. This project aims to demonstrate the implementation of basic object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in a real-world application.
