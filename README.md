# EduManageX: SCHOOL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## 🎯 Introduction 
EduManageX is a Java-based application designed to manage various school operations, including student and teacher management, financial tracking, and user authentication. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in a real-world application, focusing on modular code, encapsulation, and robust error handling.

## 🔎 Objectives

| No. | Objective |
|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Implement student and teacher registration with unique IDs and secure login management. |
| 2   | Provide financial tracking, showing income from student fees and expenditures on teacher salaries. |
| 3   | Create a simple and intuitive interface for smooth user interaction. |

## 🔬 Scope and Limitations

- **Scope✅**: This project covers student and teacher management, financial tracking, and login security, incorporating core OOP principles in a structured and user-friendly manner.
- **Limitations❌**: The system currently excludes advanced real-time data updates, complex financial accounting, and integration with external databases.

## 👀 Key Features

- **Student Management**: Register and manage students with unique IDs, tuition tracking, and grade display.
- **Teacher Management**: Register and manage teachers with unique IDs and salary tracking.
- **Financial Overview**: View a financial summary, including student tuition payments and teacher salaries.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login with minimum ID and password requirements.
- **Error Handling**: Includes input validation, retry mechanisms, and informative error messages for user inputs.
- **Liabilities and Wallet System**: Tracks student liabilities, tuition payments, and wallet top-ups.

- **Financial Summary**: Displays an overview of income from student fees versus expenditures, helping visualize the school's financial health.

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/SchoolManagementSystem.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash

    ```
3. **Compile and run the project:**
    ```bash
    javac MainUI.java
    java MainUI
    ```

## 🧠 Algorithm Explanation

- **Object-Oriented Design**: The project applies OOP principles with structured classes (`Student`, `Teacher`, `School`, etc.) that modularize different aspects of the system, making it scalable and maintainable.
- **Error Handling**: Input validation ensures correct data entry and informs users when invalid input is detected, enhancing user experience.

## 🏗 Project Architecture
- **Classes and Relationships:** The project follows a modular OOP design with key classes like `Student`, `Teacher`, and `School`. Each class has specific responsibilities, with a central `SchoolManagementSystem` that manages all instances.


## 🧪 Testing and Debugging
This project underwent rigorous testing to ensure reliability. Manual tests were performed for each feature, including:
- **Student and Teacher Registration:** Tested for unique IDs, name, and password requirements.
- **Financial Summary Calculation:** Validated income and expenditure calculations to confirm accurate financial summaries.
- **Error Handling and Retry Logic:** Ensured all inputs are validated, and users receive informative error messages.

## 🚧 Future Enhancements
Planned updates include:
- **Database Integration:** Expand the system to support external databases for more robust data handling.
- **Automated Notifications:** Add email/SMS notifications for overdue payments.
- **Data Export Options:** Enable exporting data to CSV for easy reporting.
